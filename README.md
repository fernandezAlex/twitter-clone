# Twitter Clone 
This is a clone of Twitter, with input tweet:
    1. lookup and suggest specifics #tags and mention people with @.
    2. format the tags in a different style/color
    3. format also new tags not existing in the list ( in process, I didn't have time yet to finish it )
I just use CSS, because it is a simple project for this reason I didn't use SASS o styled components.
I am working on the implementation with the Data base with Fire Base, I didn't have time yet to finish it.
Also I used the package of React Twitter Embed Component to have a simplest and fastlest way to add Twitter Widgets to the proejct.
